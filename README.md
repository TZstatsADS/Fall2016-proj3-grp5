+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for images of poodles versus images of fried chicken. We added new color features which decrease our test error by a lot. At the same time, we several classifiers on our data, such as GBM, SVM, Random Forest and Neural Network. Among these models, we select GBM as our baseline and advanced model.
